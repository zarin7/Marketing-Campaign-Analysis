## Executive Summary    
This one analyzes GlobalShala’s Facebook ad campaigns for the Superhero U event. The objective was to identify 
underperforming campaigns to reduce costs and improve ROI. 

• Objective: The primary objective of this report is to analyze GlobalShala's Facebook ad campaigns for the 
"Superhero U" event.The goal is to identify underperforming campaigns to reduce costs, optimize budget allocation, 
and improve overall Return on Investment (ROI). 

• Key Finding: Campaign 3 – SHU_Students (Australia) was identified as the least efficient campaign, with a 
significantly higher Cost per Conversion (69.32 INR) compared to all other campaigns. 

## Campaign Overview 
• Campaign Goals: The campaign was designed to drive engagement and conversions for the "Superhero U" event. 
The main goal was to attract students to the event, and this report evaluates the success of that effort across different 
regions. 

• Target Audience: The campaign targeted students.The analysis is broken down by geographical location, with 
campaigns running in different countries to reach specific student demographics. 

• Strategies & Channels: The campaign was executed exclusively through Facebook ad campaigns, leveraging the 
platform’s targeting capabilities to reach the desired student audience. 

## Data & Performance Metrics 
• Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Provides a summary of key performance indicators across 
all campaigns (1-11). It shows financial metrics (Cost per Conversion, CPC) and engagement metrics (Clicks). 

## Analysis & Insights 
• Performance: The campaign demonstrated varied performance across different geographical regions. While most 
campaigns were highly efficient, the performance of Campaign 3 (Australia) significantly impacted the overall ROI. 

• Efficient Campaigns: Campaigns 8 (Nigeria) was the most efficient. They had the lowest Cost per Conversion and 
excellent engagement metrics, including low Cost per Click (CPC). This suggests that the ad creative and targeting 
in these regions resonated strongly with the audience, leading to high-quality conversions at a low cost. According 
to engagement efficiency percentages for five countries: Nigeria, USA, UK, India, and Brazil, we have also got a 
ratio, Nigeria and USA lead with high efficiency. 

• Underperforming Campaigns: Campaign 3 (Australia) was the least efficient. Its Cost per Conversion was 
disproportionately high (69.32 INR), indicating that a significant amount of budget was spent to achieve very few 
conversions. The very low number of clicks and high CPC also confirm a lack of audience engagement, which is 
dragging down the overall ROI of the campaign. 

## Recommendation 
• Recommendation: Based on the analysis, it is strongly recommended to discontinue Campaign 3: SHU_Students 
(Australia). This action is justified by its highest Cost per Conversion and Cost Per Result, as well as its very low 
clicks and high CPC compared to other campaigns. 

• Reallocation: The budget from the discontinued Australian campaign should be reallocated to the most efficient 
campaigns, specifically those in Nigeria. This will maximize the return on investment and drive greater overall 
campaign success.
